# Test-v1

# Challenge
Create an android app with a text box centered in the middle of the screen, and a button labelled GO
When the Go button is clicked
1. validate the text in the text box
     - valid text is that which (is NOT empty) and  is a set of comma separated numbers eg "125, 254, 10, 6, 4765"
     - display an error if the text is invalid
2. if the string is valid, calculate the sum of the weights of the individual numbers and DISPLAY the answer
    i.e "125, 254, 10, 6, 4765" = (1+2+5) + (2+5+4) + (1+0) + 6 + (4+7+6+5)
